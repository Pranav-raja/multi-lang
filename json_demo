how to share variables between multiple languages:

1) JSON FILE STRUCTURE:
    The idea lies behind is the useage of json file structure for the sharing of the variable,
where one language can set the variable value and the other languages can use or manipulate the variable
    procedure of using the variable is usage of double dollar "$$Variable_Name" symbol only for those variables that are
being used across the languages
    a JSON file is created and used for storing the variables and its values
    every time the "$$" symbol is identified then the program writes a respective code for accessing the value of the
variable for the respective kind of programming languages.


WHAT IF?
--THERE ARE NESTED PROGRAMMING LANGUGES FOR ACCESING THE VARIABLES:
    consider the following example:
        <python>
            $$n = 5
            if $$n == 5:
                <js>
                    $$n = 10
                </js>
            print($$n)
        </python>

        output:
        10
